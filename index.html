        <!-- About me -->
        <p>Howdy! I'm Josh, a junior at Rice University studying Computer Science
            and Math.
        </p>
        <p>
            First things first, I'm <strong>definetely not</strong> a web developer!
            My interests instead lie at the intersection of math and computer science.
            I love algorithms and foundational CS theory; I especially enjoyed my time at Two Sigma last
            summer doing distributed storage work. The summer before that I was at John Deere working as a
            software engineering intern.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also proud of my research modeling voting errors over
            the past couple years in
            <a href="https://psychology.rice.edu/human-factors-human-computer-interaction" target="_blank">Rice's Human
                Computer Interaction Lab</a>
            (see below for a gif and a link to my first author paper). This
            upcoming fall I'm going to start doing work in
            <a href="https://rushlab.blogs.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice's Sketching and Hashing Lab</a>, and
            I couldn't be more excited!
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I like to run and go backpacking. Luckily
            those, along with programming, can all be practiced at a safe social distance.

            <h4>How to Reverse Entropy</h4>
            <p>
                I'll leave off with a little story of the making of the
                "howdy" gif to sate your curiosity (I get a lot of requests about it,
                and by that I mean one so far). 
                <br><br>
                I cannot do the story justice within this margin, but long ago 
                I was captivated by the idea of creating the "perfect" bouncing
                ball simulation. Instead of updating each ball and checking for a 
                collision, a horribly inexact updating mechanism, I projected each
                balls' path and calculated the exact intersection time for each pair, 
                then found the minimum over all such times to find the next collision.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately and to my horror, I eventually realized my simulation
                <i>wasn't</i> perfect:
                the exact solution for collision times involved square roots and 
                thus irrational numbers, and the position vector had only finite precision. 
                Even worse, because I was simulating a chaotic system, after a
                few hundred collisions the results of my simulation would have
                widely diverged from the exact solution.
                <br><br>
                Distraught, I wondered if it all my work was for naught. Was it
                even possible to construct a perfect bouncing ball simulation? 
                The repo fell into disrepair. (As a side note, I think the answer is
                no with finite compute + space, but I have some ideas for ball 
                simulation version 2 that will delay the problem for as long as possible.) 
                <br><br>
                However, when I was building this website I needed a 
                "hook" to drag a reader in (maybe it worked? you've read this far after all). 
                "Ah hah," I thought to myself, "what if I could repurpose
                my old work!" I hatched a hair brained scheme: setup a careful
                arangement of balls, then turn on a screen recorder, let the balls
                bounce, and then <i>reverse</i> the recording! 
                <br><br>
                6 hours of implementation details later (see the
                <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaEng/GasSimulation" target="_blank">repo</a>)
                I was done!
                And that's the story of how I reversed entropy. Perhaps unsurpisingly, 
                like a video of an egg getting unscrambled, the secret is simple
                movie magic.
                <br><br>
                So it goes.
