            <!-- About me -->
            <p>Howdy! I'm Josh, a junior at Rice University studying Computer Science
                and Math.
            </p>
            <p>
                First things first, I'm <strong>definetely not</strong> a web developer!
                My interests instead lie at the intersection of math and computer science.
                I love algorithms and foundational CS theory; I especially enjoyed my time at Two Sigma last
                summer doing distributed storage work. The summer before that I was at John Deere working as a
                software engineering intern.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also proud of my research modeling voting errors over
                the past couple years in
                <a href="https://psychology.rice.edu/human-factors-human-computer-interaction" target="_blank">Rice's
                    Human
                    Computer Interaction Lab</a>
                (see below for a gif and a link to my first author paper). This
                upcoming fall I'm going to start doing work in
                <a href="https://rushlab.blogs.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice's Sketching and Hashing Lab</a>, and
                I couldn't be more excited!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I like to run and go backpacking. Luckily
                those, along with programming, can all be practiced at a safe social distance.

            <h4>How to Reverse Entropy</h4>
            <p>
                I'll leave off with a little story of the making of the
                "howdy" gif to sate your curiosity (I get a lot of requests about it,
                and by that I mean one so far).
                <br><br>
                I can't do the story justice within this margin, but long ago
                I was captivated by the idea of creating the "perfect" bouncing
                ball simulation. Instead of updating each ball and checking for a
                collision, a horribly inexact updating mechanism, I projected each
                balls' path and calculated the exact intersection time for each pair,
                then found the minimum over all such times to find the next collision.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately and to my horror, I eventually realized my simulation
                <i>wasn't</i> perfect:
                the exact solution for collision times involved square roots and
                thus irrational numbers, and the position vector had only finite precision.
                Even worse, because I was simulating a chaotic system, after a
                few hundred collisions the results of my simulation would have
                wildly diverged from the exact solution.
                <br><br>
                Distraught, I wondered if it all my work was for naught. Was it
                even possible to construct a perfect bouncing ball simulation?
                The repo fell into disrepair. (As a side note, I think the answer is
                no with finite compute + space, but I have some ideas for ball
                simulation version 2 that will delay the problem for as long as possible.)
                <br><br>
                Two years pass, and we come to the modern day. When I was building
                this website I needed a "hook" to draw the reader in
                (maybe it worked? you've read this far after all).
                "Aha!" I thought to myself, "What if I could repurpose
                my old work!" I proceeded to hatch a harebrained scheme: setup a careful
                arangement of balls, then turn on a screen recorder, let the balls
                bounce, and then <i>reverse</i> the recording!
                <br><br>
                6 hours of implementation details later (see the
                <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaEng/GasSimulation" target="_blank">repo</a>)
                I was done!
                And that's the story of how I reversed entropy. Perhaps unsurpisingly,
                like a video of an egg getting unscrambled, the secret is simple
                movie magic.
                <br><br>
                So it goes.
